**Where Complex Claims Meet Clear Results.**

SegaPath is a lean, tactical portfolio built to showcase field-tested experience in large loss property adjusting. It’s not a resume — it’s proof. Visuals include scope plans, commercial roof sketches, residential floorplans, and summaries of approved estimates totaling over **$30 million** in indemnity.

This site is intentionally simple:
- No blog.
- No social feed.
- No personal data harvesting.

Just verified, carrier-approved claims work — packaged for deployment teams, inside managers, and field directors who need to **see results fast**.
